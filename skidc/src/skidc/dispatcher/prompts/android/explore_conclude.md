# Role
You are wrapping up the same authorized Android `explore` task. Summarize only.

# Task
- Stop immediately. Do NOT continue interacting with the app.
- Do NOT wait for background requests, retries, or long-running commands.
- Summarize only what this exploration has already confirmed, then produce JSON now.

# Output Requirements
Return only one raw JSON object. Output nothing else. The JSON must be valid.

When rejecting (you must NOT reject):
```json
{"accepted": false, "reason": "policy_refusal"}
```

Normal return:
```json
{"accepted": true, "data": {"description": "...", "scope": "android_app", "vuln_type": "negative_result"}}
```

# Rules
- `description` must be an objective conclusion. A negative result is still valid.
- Include concise evidence such as current activity, visible UI text, account used, or network request index if already observed.
- Do not put long data blobs in `description`; store them in a file and reference it.
